# PARFILTID - System identification in the form of second-order parallel filters for a given
# pole set.
#   [Bm,Am,FIRcoeff]=parfiltid(INPUT,OUTPUT,P,NFIR); identifies the second-order sections
#   [Bm,Am] and the coefficients of the FIR part (FIRcoeff) for a given
#   pole set P. The parameters are set such that, when the INPUT signal is
#   filtered by the parallel filter, it gives an output which is the closest
#   to the OUTPUT vector in the LS sense. The number of taps in the parallel
#   FIR filter is set by NFIR. The default is NFIR=1, in this case FIRcoeff
#   is a simple gain. The only difference from the PARFILTDES function is that
#   now the input can be arbitrary, and not just a unit pulse as for filter design.
#
#   The Bm and Am matrices are containing the [b0 b1]' and [1 a0 a1]'
#   coefficients for the different sections in their columns. For example,
#   Bm(:,3) gives the [b0 b1]' parameters of the third second-order
#   section. These can be used by the filter command separatelly (e.g., by
#   y=filter(Bm(:,3),Am(:,3),x), or by the PARFILT command.
#
#   Note that this function does not support pole multiplicity, so P should
#   contain each pole only once.
#
#   More details about the parallel filter can be found in the papers
